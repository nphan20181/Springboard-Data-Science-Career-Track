<h1>Frequentist Statistics</h1>

**Covered Concepts**
* the _z_-statistic
* the _t_-statistic
* the difference and relationship between the two
* the Central Limit Theorem, its assumptions and consequences
* estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample
* a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
* calculate confidence intervals and p-values
* perform hypothesis (or A/B) tests
